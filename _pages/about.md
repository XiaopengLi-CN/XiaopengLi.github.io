I am a third-year undergraduate student studying theoretical computer science (TCS) in Yao Class, Tsinghua University.

I mainly work on (succinct) data structures and matrix multiplication. I also have a broad interest in other fields of TCS, such as streaming algorithms, game theory, and online algorithms, though I did not have a chance to extensively work on them.
