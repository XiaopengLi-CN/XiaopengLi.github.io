**How to Pronounce My Chinese Name: 李晓鹏**

1. **Break It Down:** Let's break my name down into its individual parts to make it easier to understand and pronounce:
   - 李 (lǐ)
   - 晓 (xiǎo)
   - 鹏 (péng)
2. **Understand the Sounds:**
   - 李 (lǐ) - The "lǐ" sounds similar to the "lee" in the English word "lee," but remember to lightly touch the tip of your tongue to the back of your upper teeth.
   - 晓 (xiǎo) - The "xiǎo" sounds like "shyow" in English, with the "x" similar to the "sh" sound.
   - 鹏 (péng) - The "p" is pronounced like in English. "Péng" sounds like "pung" in English, but again, lightly touch the tip of your tongue to the back of your upper teeth.
   - **Take It Slow:** Take your time to practice each syllable and gradually put them together to form the complete name.
