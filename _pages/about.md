I am a fourth-year undergraduate student studying theoretical computer science (TCS) in Yao Class, Tsinghua University. I am applying to Ph.D. programs this year.

I mainly work on (succinct) data structures and algebraic matrix multiplication. I also have broad interests in other fields of TCS, such as streaming algorithms, game theory, and online algorithms.

See my [CV](https://orbitingflea.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
