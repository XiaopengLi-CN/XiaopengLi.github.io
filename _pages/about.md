Hi! I am a final-year (senior) undergrad majoring in Software Engineering at Qingdao University of Technology.

I mainly work on LLMs and Multi-modal Recommender Systems. I also have broad interests in other fields of GNN, such as the accuracy of the results while exploring the trustworthiness of the results.
